Subject: Rockets Firing in Israel

Dear {name},

    Another rocket was fired at Israel aiming at the city of {location}.
    As a parent who has a high school son that is studying in Israel, every
    time I receive an alert, I worry about my son and the innocent people who are being
    attacked by a recognized terrorist group.

    Over 3,100 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israeli cities and towns since Monday.
    Millions of families have spent the week in bomb shelters, as rockets rain down overhead
    and the lifesaving Iron Dome system intercepts as many missiles as it can detect.

    While Hamas deliberately targets innocent civilians, and puts countless Palestinians
    in harm's way by using the people of Gaza as human shields, there are many voices blaming
    Israel and justifying Hamasâ€™s terrorism.

    I urge you to denounce Hamas as a terrorist organization, and insist that Hamas stops
    firing rockets into Israel.

    I hope and pray, that one day soon there will be peace for both the innocent Israelis
    and Palestinians.

    Sincerely,
    Seth Lipschitz
